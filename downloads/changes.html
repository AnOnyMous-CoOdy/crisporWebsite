<h2><a href="../">CRISPOR</a> news</h2>

<h4>Version 4, Nov 2016</h4>
<p>The following features were implemented. Many thanks to the people that have contacted me, suggested features and tested them!</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole site is around 10x faster now.  Mark Diekhans/UCSC fixed the twoBit tool I use, many thanks!
<li>Genome Variants can be overlaid onto the input sequence (Matthew Canver/Harvard, Jean-Paul Concordet)
<li>Support for the Cpf1 enzyme. Its PAM is TTN. (Max)
<li>PCR page: Dropdown to select the Addgene plasmid, changes the cloning sites (Jean-Paul Concordet)
<li>Main Page: Added many more restriction enzymes and highlighted on PCR product (Saulius Zuklys, Uni Basel)
<li>Input: Guides cannot overlap Ns in the sequence (Alberto Stolfi, NYU)
<li>Main Page: Guides can be sorted by position (Virginie Virolle, Universite Nice)
<li>Main Page: Showing Bae et al. microhomology (Tsuyoshi Momose, Obs. Villefranche)
<li>PCR Page: Tm and target length can be selected for the validation primers (Jean-Michel Heslan, Univ Nantes)
<li>Main Page: Primers can be designed for off-targets and results exported to Crispresso (Max and Luca Pinello/Harvard)
<li>Input: A name for the input sequence can now be shown on all pages (Jean-Paul)
<li>PCR Page: Redesign of the input validation primers page (Max)
<li>Main Page: Showing only the best two scores now, based on our paper. Others are optional. (Max) 
<li>Main Page: Sorting the off-targets by CFD score now (Max, Virginie Virolle)
<li>PCR Page - Protocols: cloning in Ciona (Alberto), off-target sequencing (Matthew Canver), synthesis (Ann de Cian, MNHN Paris)
<li>UCSC Browser: Browser tracks with pre-computed guides for the major model organisms (Max)
<li>Local install: Off-target Excel export now includes the strand (Max). This changes the output format but was necessary.
<li>Local installation/offline-mode: all .js and .css files are now included in the distribution
<li>Local install: license is now free for academic use only. (Max)
</ul>
