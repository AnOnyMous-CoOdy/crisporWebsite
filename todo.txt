color off-targets by whether they are in a COSMIC gene or not.

Color all scores and add Jensen et al :
- talbot.39@osu.edu
- p.s. red/yellow/green indicators would also help for predicted effeciency / out of frame scores.
- > One thing that I look for, which is not shown here is a test for self-complimentarity.
- I've often hear this and probably should add it. Is this the mfold score as published in Jenssen et al? Do you want to see the RNAfold diagram, too?
- Mfold score would be fine; if you could code it red/yellow/green to indicate good/bad scores that would help too.
- cfp1 support
- show all guides for all PAMs together
- suppress all eff scores but Fusi and Moreno
- knock-in support

Add these new criteria:
- Thyme/Schier: http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/scoring.php, add a column?
  see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27282953
- Jensen et al: Chromatin and secondary structure 
   http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1873-3468.12707/full
- Jennifer's zebrafish model

Show distance of off-targets from the on-target! 

Show a histogram of the mismatches instead of 0-0-10-15-40

What is site-seq and circle-seq?
- add note to crispor batch and sat mut assistant about meaning of barcode?

auto-downloader:
- download genome to "genome"
- download gff to "gff"
- check if filetype is gz, extract
- check if type is really fasta
- check if annot is really gff
- check if sequences do not contain spaces
- try to pick out a certain field from the fasta ID lines, is possible
- translate genome to 2bit
- create chrom.sizes
- check if gff-chroms match genome chromes
- if not: skip gff
- do the gff translation, if error: skip gff
- index the fasta
- keep a log of everything
- on success, reindex genomes and send out the log to email
- use rabbitmq
- split on " ", or ";"

- feature UCSC more prominently:
  - output page must activate the track in the link to UCSC!
  - show link maybe even before the job is submitted

- "enter gene name" -> redirect to UCSC 
- show all guides for all PAMs together
  - multi-PAM: "need alternative PAM" ? show them in grey
- score CrisprA/CrisprI
- design a library for a list of genes
  - library design: input: list of genes, how many guides per gene, annotate with libraries?
  - output as excel: geneSym, guideSeq, transcripts, % in CDS, scores, guideSeq
  - also on guide overview page: show which ones are in gecko/brunello etc
  - more precalc of guides / whole genome -> library design
- knock-in support -> concentrate onto GFP-fusions
  - knock-in support
  - what are the typical use cases: promoter/enhancer/knock-in/knock-out (=exon-removal)
- add-genome tool

- base de donnes:
-- text mining?
-- guides valides des cribles: ajouter si le guide etait deja utilise
(Sanger? Base de NIH zebrafish?)
   fournir dans les tracks UCSC les guides des gènes essentiels  déjà testés dans les cribles et renvoyer un lien 
   à GenomeCRISPR  de Heidelberg pour plus détails ?

Analyses:
- variantes Cas9: kleinstiver VQR guideSeq <-> CFD ?
   me semble vraiment important et original !
   c’est par exemple possible de comparer et confirmer la supériorité de CFD
   sur les MIT score pour ces variants.
- Cpf1: guideSeq <-> CFD ?
  pour Cpf1 il fait designer un score à la main, comme CCTOP par exemple .
- screens:
  - TKO http://tko.ccbr.utoronto.ca/

  - Croatan guides:

    protocol in http://croatan.hannonlab.org/files/Supplementary_Protocol.pdf



- how many published guides may be affected by variants in off-targets?

  pas évident, ça doit être facile d’identifier tous les variants qui diminuent
  l’activité de off^targets (en passant de n mismatches à n+1) dans le sens
  inverse, c’est plus compliqué de trouver les variants qui augmentent
  l’activité de offtargets (en passant de n mismatches à n-1) puisqu’il faut
  faire les calculs pour avoir tous les off avec 5mm et voir ceux dont les
  variant font passer à 4 mm.
  
Done:
- cfp1 support
- suppress all eff scores but Fusi and Moreno
- remove Tefor menu from Pcr pages
- use case: hammer a region (enhancer) with guides: saturating mutagenesis libraries
- serial cloner support
- activate repeat filtering for the primer design !
  (find the option in primer3 to remove low-complexity sequences)


To: Zachary Gilbert
Awesome! That was really fast! I just tested it out with a region we used
before and it gave us the same guides that worked well for us when we tested
them in mosquitoes. When I started looking for guides, about a year ago, I used
Chop-Chop and Crispr.MIT.edu. More recently, I have been using Benchling
because the interface was a little simpler, but none of them are updating
genomes right now, and the Aedes genome 5 is much more representative of the
actual genome than version 3, which is  important to us, since we have had a
few occasions where we were trying guides in regions with a lot of SNPs, so not
many of them worked well. We also tried a few downloadable tools, although I
never got very far with them, since I ran into some weird permissions and
compatibility problems on our server.

For my needs, I prefer being able to enter a sequence and have the tool give me
guides in that sequence to choose from, the way it does now, since we often
want to, for example, find a guide very close to the stop codon, so we can
label a gene while, mostly, maintaining its function. Some of my lab mates,
though, would want to be able to enter a gene name and have it spit out a list
of good guides in the first and second exon of a gene, for creating knockouts.
Thanks again, this will be super helpful for finding guides for our next few
projects
Zach
