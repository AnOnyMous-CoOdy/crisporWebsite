<h2><a href="../">CRISPOR</a> Changes</h2>
<p>Many thanks to the users that have contacted me, suggested features and tested them!</p>

<h4>Version 4.4, April 2018 - Cpf1/saCas9 scores</h4>
<ul>
<li>More prominent warning for TTTT-containing guides directly in the table (thanks to Kis Adras, NAIK Hungary)
<li>Fixed table layout bug on Firefox, thanks to referee 2 of NAR paper
<li>Cpf1: added DeepCpf1 efficiency scores, thanks to Seonwoo Min at Soul National University for the help
<li>SaCas9 scoring: got Najm et al 2018 model, thanks to Mudra Hegde and John Doench, Broad Inst.
<li>A new CRISPOR manual, <a href="../manual/">here</a>
<li>Added xCas9, currently shows all the old spCas9 scores
</ul>

<h4>Version 4.3, Oct 2017 - CRISPOR Batch</h4>
<ul>
<li>New tool: CRISPOR Batch for lentiviral screens (suggested by Matt Canver)
<li>Primers are not designed in repeated regions anymore (thanks Yueh-Chiang Hu!)
<li>Fixing two bugs reported by Bernadette Neve: crash on many Ns in off-target, crash when no primers found in bulk primer design
</ul>

<h4>Version 4.2, June 2017 - Saturation mutagenesis</h4>
<ul>
<li>Saturation Mutagenesis Tool (Matt Canver, Luca Pinello)
<li>Genbank-like formats for various plasmid editors and Fasta export (Jean-Paul)
<li>Better command line support (Luca Pinello)
<li>PCR page: Fixed bad bug in T7 plasmid primer (many thanks to Macie Walker)
<li>PCR page: Changed lentiCrisprV2 enzyme Bbs1 -> BsmBI (thanks to Erin Simonds, UCSF)
<li>Fixed crash with unicode in batch name (thanks to Thom Saunders, U Mich)
<li>External websites can now pre-fill out the input form with values for the genome (parameter: "org") or a sequence (parameter: "seq"). Thanks to Patrick Lemaire, U Montpellier, and Frank Perez, INSERM Paris
<li>Fixed: Genbank download crash for unscored guides, adding better Geneious support (Alyce Chen, Harvard)
<li>Fixed: crash on primers for genomes without gene annotations (Hugues Renault, CNRS Strassburg)
</ul>

<h4>Version 4.0, Mar 2017 - Cpf1, Variants, sequence names, AddGene plasmids, UCSC tracks</h4>
<p>The following features were implemented. Many thanks to the people that have contacted me, suggested features and tested them!</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole site is around 10x faster now.  Mark Diekhans/UCSC fixed the twoBit tool I use, many thanks!
<li>Genome Variants can be overlaid onto the input sequence (Matthew Canver/Harvard, Jean-Paul Concordet)
<li>Support for the Cpf1 enzyme. Its PAM is TTTN. (Max)
<li>Input: Guides cannot overlap Ns in the sequence (Alberto Stolfi, NYU)
<li>Input: A name for the input sequence can now be shown on all pages (Jean-Paul)
<li>Main Page: Added many more restriction enzymes and highlighted on PCR product (Saulius Zuklys, Uni Basel)
<li>Main Page: Guides can be sorted by position (Virginie Virolle, Universite Nice)
<li>Main Page: Click OOF score to show Bae et al. microhomology (Tsuyoshi Momose, Villefranche)
<li>Main Page: Primers can be designed for off-targets and results exported to Crispresso (Max and Luca Pinello/Harvard)
<li>Main Page: Showing only the best two scores now, based on our paper. Others are optional. (Max) 
<li>Main Page: Sorting the off-targets by CFD score now (Max, Virginie Virolle)
<li>Main Page: Show only guides that start with G- or A- (Peter Rogowsky, ENS Lyon)
<li>Download: Adding sequence and version info to Excel file (Soren Warming/Max)
<li>PCR page: Fixed bad bug in T7 plasmid primer (many thanks to Macie Walker)
<li>PCR page: Dropdown to select the Addgene plasmid, changes the cloning sites (Jean-Paul Concordet)
<li>PCR Page: Tm and target length can be selected for the validation primers (Jean-Michel Heslan, Univ Nantes)
<li>PCR Page: Redesign of the input validation primers page (Max)
<li>PCR Page - more protocols: cloning in Ciona (Alberto), off-target sequencing (Matthew Canver, MIT), synthesis (Ann de Cian, MNHN Paris)
<li>UCSC Browser: Browser tracks with pre-computed guides for the major model organisms (Max)
<li>Local install: Off-target Excel export now includes the strand (Max). This changes the output format but was necessary.
<li>Local installation/offline-mode: all .js and .css files are now included in the distribution
<li>Local install: license is now free for academic use only. (Max)
</ul>
